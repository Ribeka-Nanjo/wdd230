					First of all, we can see the size contrast in the texts. It
					helps make them readable and legible so that Users can
					quickly know what the page is they are looking for. Next, we
					can see the color contrast in the buttons. For example, the
					blue “buy” button is different from other action buttons.
					The design leads users to take action (buying or browsing.)
